# Status
This project is currently on standby due to the recent updates, i can't seem to properly detect the level and multiplayer stuff, if you do have an idea on how to do it, you can reach out to me on Discord or with the Issues / Pull requests
I'm up to start something new if i can't find a solution for this aka directly modifying the source code of SRB2, as i never did C coding, i would use some help so reach out to me on Discord if you want (Refrag#7238)

# SRB2-Rich-Presence
A program that will display your current state in game on Discord

# How to use:
Simply put the executable and the DLLs in your SRB2 root folder and launch SRB2 Rich Presence.exe

Note: you need to use version 2.2.6 of SRB2 and this program will only work for the vanilla game

Note 2: you can put command line arguments the same way you would do it with the SRB2 executable

# How to build:
Open the solution on Visual Studio and build it from here
